# GeneratorClient

A client side application made for communicating with my Stablediffusion Generator application running in a cloud environment. 
This client will eventually aim to make testing configurations for generation more smoothly.

## Some planned features are: 

**Prompt builder**: (negative) prompt builder with the use of a categorized catelog of most commonly used things in (negative) prompts. 
Flow aims to have easy drag/drop & add/remove systems to quickly build up (negative) prompts based on earlier used options.

**Rating system**: i would like to add some statistical side to the project by asking ratings based on results and recording this so we can do data analysis on the data to see if there is any correlation between certain settings and prompt categories for example. 

To be continued...
